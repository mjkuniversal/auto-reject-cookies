Version 1.5.0 - Shopify Support, Scroll Fix & Domain Tracking

New Features:
- Added support for Shopify's native cookie consent banner (used by goodr.com and many other Shopify stores)
- Added domain-level tracking: once cookies are rejected on a domain, the extension skips re-processing for 1 hour, preventing repeated banner interactions on sites like gamestop.com

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed page scrolling to bottom after cookie banner dismissal — scroll position is now preserved before and after clicking reject buttons

Technical Changes:
- Added Shopify CMP entry with selectors: #shopify-pc__banner__btn-decline, .shopify-pc__banner__btn-decline, #shopify-pc__prefs__header-decline
- tryClick() now saves and restores window scroll position around element.click()
- Handled domains stored in browser.storage.local with automatic expiry and cleanup
- Domain normalization strips www. prefix so www.example.com and example.com are treated as the same site

Notes to Reviewer:

No account required for testing.

To test Shopify cookie banner support:
1. Clear cookies for goodr.com or use a private window
2. Visit https://goodr.com (banner appears for EU/CA visitors)
3. The extension should automatically click the "Decline" button on the Shopify banner

To test scroll position fix:
1. Visit any site with a cookie banner
2. Scroll partway down the page, then reload
3. When the banner is dismissed, the page should NOT jump to the bottom

To test domain tracking:
1. Visit a site with a cookie banner (e.g., any OneTrust site)
2. The extension rejects the banner on the first page
3. Navigate to other pages on the same site — the extension skips processing (check console for "[Auto Reject Cookies] Skipping - domain already handled recently" with DEBUG=true)

The extension requires no external services or accounts - it operates entirely client-side by detecting and clicking cookie consent UI elements.
