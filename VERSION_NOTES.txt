Version 1.6.0 - TeamGroup Support

New Features:
- Added custom handler for TeamGroup (teamgroupinc.com) cookie consent banner, which has no "Reject All" button

Technical Changes:
- Added TeamGroup entry to KNOWN_CMPS array with custom handler
- Custom handler unchecks #cookie_functional and #cookie_marketing checkboxes, then clicks the "Confirm" button (a.privacyTrigger.acceptCustom) to save with only necessary cookies
- Dispatches change events on checkboxes for jQuery listener compatibility

Notes to Reviewer:

No account required for testing.

To test TeamGroup cookie banner support:
1. Clear cookies for teamgroupinc.com or use a private window
2. Visit https://www.teamgroupinc.com
3. The extension should automatically uncheck functional/marketing cookie checkboxes and click "Confirm"
4. With DEBUG=true in content.js, console shows "[Auto Reject Cookies] Rejected via TeamGroup (unchecked optional + confirm)"

The extension requires no external services or accounts - it operates entirely client-side by detecting and clicking cookie consent UI elements.
