Version 1.7.0 - InMobi/Quantcast CMP Fix & TeamGroup Support

New Features:
- Improved Quantcast/InMobi Choice CMP handling — adds options-view "Confirm" button selector and desktop variant support (fixes 1001fonts.com and similar sites)
- Added custom handler for TeamGroup (teamgroupinc.com) cookie consent banner, which has no "Reject All" button

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed Quantcast/InMobi settings button selector using mode="secondary" instead of :first-child to avoid accidentally clicking "Agree"
- Made "to" optional in "object to all" reject pattern to also match "OBJECT ALL"
- Hardened TeamGroup domain check to use exact match instead of substring match
- Prevented anchor scroll on TeamGroup confirm button click

Technical Changes:
- Added '.qc-cmp2-buttons-desktop button[mode="secondary"]' selector for Quantcast desktop variant
- Added '.qc-cmp2-footer button[mode="primary"]' selector for Confirm button in Quantcast/InMobi options view
- Added TeamGroup entry to KNOWN_CMPS array with custom handler that unchecks #cookie_functional and #cookie_marketing, then clicks a.privacyTrigger.acceptCustom
- Updated KNOWN_CMP_SETTINGS_SELECTORS to use mode="secondary" for Quantcast

Notes to Reviewer:

No account required for testing.

To test InMobi/Quantcast CMP fix:
1. Clear cookies for 1001fonts.com or use a private window
2. Visit https://www.1001fonts.com
3. The extension should handle the InMobi Choice cookie banner (click "More Options" then "Confirm")
4. With DEBUG=true in content.js, console shows Quantcast/InMobi Choice selector matches

To test TeamGroup cookie banner support:
1. Clear cookies for teamgroupinc.com or use a private window
2. Visit https://www.teamgroupinc.com
3. The extension should automatically uncheck functional/marketing cookie checkboxes and click "Confirm"
4. With DEBUG=true in content.js, console shows "[Auto Reject Cookies] Rejected via TeamGroup (unchecked optional + confirm)"

The extension requires no external services or accounts - it operates entirely client-side by detecting and clicking cookie consent UI elements.
